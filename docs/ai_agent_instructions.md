# AI Agent Instructions for Agricultural MCP Integration

## Specialized in Corn, Wheat, and Sunflower Cultivation

## Overview

This document provides instructions for AI agents to utilize the Agricultural Model Context Protocol (MCP) for providing expert guidance on cereal and oilseed crop farming. The system is designed to deliver location-specific recommendations by analyzing climate data, weather conditions, soil parameters, and environmental factors.

## Initial Setup

1. Initialize your context with the farming location:

```json
POST /api/agent/initialize
{
    "timestamp": "<current_UTC_time>",
    "location": {
        "latitude": <farm_latitude>,
        "longitude": <farm_longitude>
    },
    "current_task": "crop_planning",
    "confidence_threshold": 0.8
}
```

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Crop Selection and Timing

For each supported crop (corn, wheat, sunflowers), provide guidance based on:

- **Climate Zone Analysis**

  - Use weather forecasts to determine optimal planting windows
  - Analyze historical weather patterns
  - Consider day length and frost dates

- **Seasonal Planning**
  ```json
  POST /api/agent/crop-management
  {
    "query": {
      "crop_type": "<crop_name>",
      "soil_type": "<soil_classification>",
      "climate_zone": "<zone_classification>",
      "planting_season": "<spring|summer|fall>",
      "field_history": [<previous_crops>]
    }
  }
  ```

### 2. Soil Management

- **Pre-planting Analysis**
  ```json
  POST /api/agent/soil-analysis
  {
    "query": {
      "soil_parameters": {
        "ph_level": <current_ph>,
        "organic_matter": <percentage>,
        "nutrient_levels": {
          "nitrogen": <value>,
          "phosphorus": <value>,
          "potassium": <value>
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

### 3. Irrigation Management

Develop precise irrigation schedules considering:

- Crop water requirements
- Growth stage
- Weather conditions
- Soil moisture levels

```json
POST /api/agent/irrigation-schedule
{
    "query": {
        "crop_type": "<crop_name>",
        "growth_stage": "<stage_name>",
        "soil_moisture": <current_percentage>,
        "irrigation_method": "<drip|sprinkler|flood>",
        "weather_forecast": "<forecast_data>"
    }
}
```

### 4. Pest and Disease Management

Monitor and recommend treatments for:

```json
POST /api/agent/pest-control
{
    "query": {
        "crop_type": "<crop_name>",
        "growth_stage": "<stage_name>",
        "pest_type": "<pest_identification>",
        "infestation_level": "<low|medium|high>",
        "treatment_history": [<previous_treatments>]
    }
}
```

## Crop-Specific Guidelines

### Corn (Zea mays)

1. **Planting Conditions**

   - Soil temperature: 50째F (10째C) or higher
   - Planting depth: 1.5-2 inches

   - VE (emergence): 5-7 days after planting
   - V1-V6: Early vegetative growth
   - VT: Tasseling
   - R1: Silking
   - R6: Physiological maturity

3. **Irrigation Requirements**
   - Critical periods:
     - V8-V16 (rapid growth)
     - R1 (silking)
     - R2-R3 (kernel development)

### Wheat (Triticum aestivum)

1. **Planting Conditions**

   - Winter wheat: Plant 6-8 weeks before first frost
   - Spring wheat: Plant as early as soil can be worked
   - Planting depth: 1-2 inches
   - Row spacing: 6-8 inches

2. **Growth Stages Monitoring**

   - Germination and emergence
   - Tillering
   - Stem elongation

        "reasoning": "<detailed_explanation>"
    },
    "recommendations": [
        "Specific action item 1",
        "Specific action item 2"
    ],
    "next_actions": [
        "Follow-up task 1",
        "Follow-up task 2"
    ],
    "context_updates": {
